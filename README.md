This is a personal project that I fully designed and developed on my own using [Convex](https://convex.dev) as the backend platform and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the frontend.

The app is connected to my Convex deployment: [`acrobatic-fox-937`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/acrobatic-fox-937).
